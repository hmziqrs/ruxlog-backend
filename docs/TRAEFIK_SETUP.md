# Traefik Deployment Guide

## Overview
Traefik sits in front of the containers, terminates HTTPS via Let's Encrypt, and routes requests to services that advertise themselves with labels. No manual template edits are requiredâ€”add the right labels, and Traefik discovers the app automatically.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Engine 24+ with the Compose plugin (`docker compose version`).
- Public DNS pointing `BACKEND_DOMAIN` (and any other exposed hosts) to this server.
- Firewall rules that allow inbound TCP 80/443 (e.g. `ufw allow 80`, `ufw allow 443`).

## Configure Environment Variables
Compose interpolates label values at launch time. Provide them either by exporting variables in your shell or by creating an env file you pass to every `docker compose` command. Example `deploy.env`:

```env
PROJECT=ruxlog
BACKEND_DOMAIN=api.example.com
BACKEND_RATE_AVG=10
BACKEND_RATE_BURST=20
```

Load it whenever you orchestrate the stack:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy.env -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Prepare Traefik
1. Copy `traefik/.env.prod.example` to `traefik/.env.prod` and set `PROJECT` plus the Let's Encrypt contact email (`ACME_EMAIL`).
2. Create the ACME storage file once with the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   cd traefik
   mkdir -p data
   touch data/acme.json
   chmod 600 data/acme.json
   ```
3. Start the backend stack from the repository root (ensures the shared `${PROJECT}_network` exists):
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file deploy.env -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```
4. Launch Traefik from the repository root:
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file traefik/.env.prod -f traefik/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```
   Traefik binds to ports 80/443, listens on the `${PROJECT}_network`, and uses the Docker provider to read service labels. Certificates are requested automatically through the HTTP-01 challenge and stored in `traefik/data/acme.json`.

## Adding More Services
- Attach the service container to `${PROJECT}_network` and add labels such as:
  ```yaml
  labels:
    - traefik.enable=true
    - traefik.http.routers.myapp.rule=Host(`app.example.com`)
    - traefik.http.routers.myapp.entrypoints=websecure
    - traefik.http.routers.myapp.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
    - traefik.http.services.myapp.loadbalancer.server.port=3000
  ```
- Optional middlewares (rate limiting, redirects) are configured via labels as well; refer to `docker-compose.prod.yml` for examples.
- Changes take effect with `docker compose up -d`; Traefik hot-reloads without a container restart.

## Operational Tips
- Back up `traefik/data/acme.json` if you rebuild the host to avoid Let's Encrypt rate limits.
- Inspect routing and certificate events with `docker logs ${PROJECT}_traefik`.
- Enable the dashboard for troubleshooting by adding `--api.dashboard=true` to the Traefik command list and protecting it behind Basic Auth.
- For local work, use `docker compose --env-file deploy.env -f traefik/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`; dev routing uses HTTP only and still relies on labels.

## Troubleshooting
- **ACME token errors**: confirm that port 80 is reachable from the internet and the DNS record resolves to this server.
- **404s from Traefik**: make sure the request host matches a router rule and that the target container is connected to `${PROJECT}_network`.
- **Certificates not persisting**: double-check the permissions and bind mount for `traefik/data/acme.json`.
